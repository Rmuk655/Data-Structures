# Assignment 1: 
Implementing a Stack using a singly linked list of float elements.
Using abstraction, constructors, copy constructors, operator overloading.
Structuring code across multiple files: LinkedList.h, LinkedList.cpp, Stack.h, Stack.cpp, testStack.h, main.cpp.
Writing a Makefile and testing using GCC.
Including test cases and expected outputs.

# Objective
Design and implement a Stack of float values using a custom LinkedList class. This will reinforce your understanding of class design, memory management, abstraction, and code modularity in C++.
You will structure your project into multiple .h and .cpp files, following best software development practices, and include a test suite and a main.cpp file.

# 🧪 Test Cases
| Test Case | Action                             | Expected Output           |
|-----------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1         | Push 5.5, 3.3, 2.2                 | Stack: 2.2 3.3 5.5        |
| 2         | Pop top (2.2)                      | Stack: 3.3 5.5            |
| 3         | Check `top()`                      | 3.3                       |
| 4         | Pop all, check `empty()`           | true                      |
| 5         | Copy constructor: `Stack s2(s1);`  | `s2` identical to `s1`    |
| 6         | Assignment: `s2 = s1`              | `s2` identical to `s1`    |
| 7         | Push after copy, original unchanged| `s2 != s1`                |
| 8         | Check size after multiple pushes   | Size: 3                   |
| 9         | Pop from empty                     | Return false              |
| 10        | Print empty stack                  | No output or “empty”      |

# 🛠️ Build Instructions

1. Create a `Makefile` with these rules:
   - `make`

2. Compile and run using:
   ```bash
   make
   ./main

make clean
.\Stack_app.exe
